			<p>
				Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which

				then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit,
				or to another website that recognizes that cookoie. Cookies are
				useful because they allow a website to recognize a user’s device.

			</p>
			<p>Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate
				between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and
				generally improving the user experience. They can also help to
				ensure that advertisements you see online are more relevant to you
				and your interests.</p>
			<p>The cookies used on this website have been categorized based
				on the categories found in the ICC UK Cookie guide:</p>
			<ul>

					essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use
					its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website.
					Without these cookies services you have asked for, like shopping
					baskets or e-billing, cannot be provided.</li>
				<li>Category 2: Performance Cookies. These cookies collect
					information about how visitors use a website, for instance which
					pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages
					from web pages. These cookies don't collect information that
					identify a visitor. All information these cookies collect is
					aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how
					a website works.</li>
				<li>Category 3: Functionality Cookies. These cookies allow the
					website to remember choices you make (such as your user name,
					language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more
					personal features. For instance, a website may be able to provide
					you with local weather reports or traffic news by storing in a
					cookie the region in which you are currently located. These cookies
					can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size,
					fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customize. They may
					also be used to provide services you have asked for such as
					watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these
					cookies collect may be anonymized and they cannot track your
					browsing activity on other websites.</li>
				<li>Category 4: Targeting Cookies or Advertising Cookies. These
					cookies are used to deliver advertisements more relevant to you and
					your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you
					see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of
					the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising
					networks with the website operator's permission. They remember that
					you have visited a website and this information is shared with
					other organizations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or
					advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided
					by the other organization.</li>
